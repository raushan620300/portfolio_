        Hey I`m pursuing my
        <b><abbr title="Bachelor of Computer Application">BCA</abbr> degree from
          Veer Kunwar Singh University.</b>
        I`m not fit for the answer but still, I want to share my views for this
        course.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, BCA is a <b>professional course.</b> I`m writing down for
        all the subjects you`re going to study in BCA.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <ol>
          <li>C, C++, Java</li>
          <li>
            Accounts, Eco, Business Studies(10+2 level, only for one semester)
          </li>
          <li>Web technologies like HTML, Advance HTML, CSS, JS</li>
          <li>DBMS- SQl and all</li>
          <li>Communication System</li>
          <li>Statistics</li>
          <li>Numerical techniques</li>
          <li>Algorithm design</li>
          <li>Computer Archietecture and Organisation</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Try to clear all the exams ina first attempt. This will reduce your burden
        and you have time to learn new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past two years, I`ve learned so many things except programming
        languages. My problem solving is increased I`m calmer, polite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust this isn`t enough in this world. Learn things which are trending in
        the market like Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly work on your body, personality etc. Keep experimenting
        with new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion BCA isn`t enough for good job and better salary. It also
        depends on your personal skills, when I chose this course I hadn`t much
        technical skills.Today`s most of tech companies search[[]] highly skilled developers. And nowdays, 
        <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> fastly spreading in tech market. Most of companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and some companies using this technology. So, you should also focuse on this AI course.
        I suggest to you if you choose BCA then you must have
        technical and also communication skills because it`s helful for you and
        after graduate from BCA so you can also go to pursuing MCA from best
        colleges.
      </p>
      <p>I think its enough.</p>
      <p>Good Luck.</p>
